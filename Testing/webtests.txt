(Ethan Seither): All tests for the next beer website are in the
next-beer-website/tests directory. The majority of these are unit tests which
ensure the functionality of particular services we call and rely on in both the
API (mobile app) and the weebsite, which has much of the same functionality as
the mobile app, but does not implement it in the same way. 

The main equivalence classes that we tests are the various states that a user
can be in, as well as the various states of a beer. Most of the functionality
of our app relies on the interplay between a user and the beers in our
database, so we need to ensure that we have a consistent behavior regardless of
possible differences between the two. There are certain edge cases, like our
reccomendation algorithm performing correctly on a user who has not created a
taste profile yet, as this is a large part of our recommendation system.

Further, we need to handle the edge case that a user has not rated any beers,
or has rated all the beers in the database, we try to ensure that we do not
ever recommend a beer the user has tried and rated in the past, but there are
certain scenarios where this is the only valid option, so we needed to ensure
that this behavior works correctly.
